### Predicting Housing Price

### Topic: Predicting house price in Boston using Machine Learning

### Project overview:

In this project, I have used the Boston housing data to perform housing price prediction and analysis using Machine Learning. The objective of this problem is
to predict the monetary value of a house located the Boston suburbs. One of the biggest investments that most people make in their lifetime is usually in the 
Housing market. And the housing prices are ever increasing – In big cities like Boston, New York etc, housing prices are easily in the north of 1 Million Dollars.
The end use buyer of a house is often left with this dauting question before a housing purchase or sell – Will the price of the house increase or decrease in the
coming times ? Hence, if we are able to predict the price of the house using Machine learning tools and techniques, it will be a great tool in the hands of 
ordinary customers and investors alike to make a informed decision of their trade, and avoid being fooled around by drastic price changes. So the main question 
that is being answered through this project is how can we estimate the house price based on some key characteristics like Area, Size, age of property, 
Number of bedrooms etc. 

I have started the project with Exploratory data analysis of the dataset. I have plotted correlation matrix to see the features that have strong correlation 
with the Pricing of the house. Also, various histograms were plotted to see how the features are distributed. Next, I have performed data cleanup for any missing
data, and made sure there are no missing values before its fed into the ML Models. I have developed Linear regression and SVM Models and calculated the accuracies 
of the prediction by the models. The model that was consistently showing better results was chosen as the ML model for prediction for this project.
